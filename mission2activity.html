            <h1>Find Your Librarian!</h1>
            <p>This week you will:

find a painting with a historical theme
work with a librarian to research the painting and its painter using the library collections and understand how material is organized in the library (remember to take a selfie)
write a letter about this experience
---------------------------
1. Find a painting:

The painting must have a historical subject, but it can cover any topic, time period, or location.
Your letter should describe the painting and place it in its artistic, social, political and historical context with some expertise.
Your letter should also articulate how this painting is a primary source, or if it is part of a historical argument, interpretation or analysis
