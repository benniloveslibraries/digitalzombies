            <h1>Diaries Of The Past</h1>
            <p>Think about what you did today/this week for this class and sketch out how you would write a diary entry. Now rewrite it as if your were: Martha Ballard, Anne Frank or Che Guevara. Your diary entry should be at least 250 words, and resemble in style and content the entries of the character you choose to embody.

Links to online archives and written examples of each are included in the readings - these must inform the tone of your entries.

The challenge here is that you will not be writing about anything either Martha, Anne or Che ever wrote about, but you will need to place yourself in their world, their perspective and their writing style.

Your references to evidence will need to be true to the style of each writer, as will the interpretations of each.</p>
