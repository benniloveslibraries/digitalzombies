            <p>Part of not being a DZ requires you know how to think like one, or think like one that might want to take advantage of a DZ. In order to this, you are going to create a fake history - complete with a fake primary source and analysis. It should be believable - but fake. Your final report will be the presentation of your (fake) evidence as proof of an alternative interpretation to widely accepted historical events. (scroll down to the description of the Final Report for details)

In order to lie well, you need to have a good sense of what you are lying about, so think about a time in history you are familiar with, and think about how you might change common interpretations of it. You cannot change the outcome (so you can't undo the Lincoln assassination), but you can 'find' new evidence that might shed new light on the event, or on the Lincoln presidency as a whole.

Avoid conspiracy theories and alien stories - neither are believable.</p>
